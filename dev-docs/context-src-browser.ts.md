# High Level Context
## context
This file, src/browser.ts, defines a class called Ollama that provides an interface for interacting with an Ollama server. The class includes methods for various operations such as:

1. Generating responses from text prompts
2. Chatting with the model
3. Creating new models
4. Pulling and pushing models from/to the Ollama registry
5. Deleting models
6. Copying models
7. Listing models
8. Showing model metadata
9. Embedding text into vectors

The class handles both streaming and non-streaming requests, and includes functionality for aborting ongoing streamed requests. It also handles image encoding for requests that include images.

The file exports the Ollama class, a default instance of the class, and all types from the interfaces.js file for easy importing in other parts of the application.

# Ollama src/browser.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama appears to be a class that represents a client for interacting with an Ollama service or API. Here's a concise explanation of its key components:

1. It manages configuration settings, including the host URL for the Ollama service.
2. It uses a customizable fetch function for making HTTP requests.
3. It keeps track of ongoing streamed requests, allowing for their abortion if needed.
4. The constructor initializes the configuration and fetch function, with default values that can be overridden.
5. It provides an abort method to cancel all ongoing streamed requests.

This class seems to be designed as a foundation for making requests to an Ollama service, likely for natural language processing or AI-related tasks, with built-in support for request management and cancellation.
