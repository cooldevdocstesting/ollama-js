# High Level Context
## context
This file (src/index.ts) appears to be the main entry point for an Ollama client library, likely for interacting with an Ollama API. It extends a browser-based Ollama class and adds additional functionality for handling local file operations and model creation. Key features include:

1. Image encoding for API requests
2. Modelfile parsing and processing
3. File path resolution and existence checking
4. Blob creation and management for model files
5. An extended 'create' method for model creation with support for both streaming and non-streaming responses

The class provides methods to work with local files, encode images, parse modelfiles, and create models. It also handles file paths, blob creation, and SHA256 hashing for model files. The code is designed to work in both browser and Node.js environments, with some functionality specific to Node.js (like file system operations).

The file exports the Ollama class, a default instance of the class, and all types from the interfaces file, making it a comprehensive entry point for the Ollama client library.

# Ollama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama is a class that extends OllamaBrowser. It appears to be part of a larger system for handling and processing machine learning models. Here's a concise explanation of its key features:

1. Image Encoding: It can encode images into base64 format, handling various input types (Uint8Array, Buffer, or string).

2. Modelfile Parsing: It parses modelfiles, replacing certain commands (FROM and ADAPTER) with corresponding blob hashes.

3. Path Resolution: It resolves file paths, handling both relative and absolute paths.

4. File Operations: It includes methods for checking file existence and creating blobs from files.

5. Blob Creation: It creates blobs from files, computing SHA256 digests and handling file streaming.

6. Model Creation: It provides methods for creating models, either from a file path or modelfile content.

The class seems to be designed to work with a specific API or system that handles machine learning models, providing utility functions for file handling, encoding, and model creation. It's likely part of a larger framework or library for managing and deploying machine learning models.
