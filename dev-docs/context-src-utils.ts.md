# High Level Context
## context
This TypeScript file (src/utils.ts) contains utility functions and classes for making HTTP requests and handling responses. Key components include:

1. A ResponseError class for handling API errors
2. An AbortableAsyncIterator class for handling abortable asynchronous operations
3. Wrapper functions for HTTP methods (get, head, post, delete) with added headers and error checking
4. A parseJSON function to handle streaming JSON responses
5. A formatHost function to standardize host string formatting
6. Helper functions for checking response status and determining the platform

The file provides a set of tools for making API calls, handling responses, and managing common tasks related to HTTP requests in a TypeScript environment.

# ResponseError src/utils.ts
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `ResponseError` class in the given code snippet:

`ResponseError` is a custom error class that extends the built-in `Error` class. It is designed to represent errors related to HTTP responses. The class has the following characteristics:

1. It takes two parameters in its constructor: `error` (a string describing the error) and `status_code` (a number representing the HTTP status code).

2. Both `error` and `status_code` are declared as public properties, making them accessible outside the class.

3. It calls the parent `Error` constructor with the `error` message.

4. It sets the `name` property to 'ResponseError' for easier identification of this specific error type.

5. It uses `Error.captureStackTrace` (if available) to capture and attach the stack trace to the error object, excluding the constructor call itself from the stack trace.

This custom error class allows for creating more specific and informative error objects when dealing with HTTP responses, including both an error message and a status code.
